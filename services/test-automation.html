We have developed a methodology that simplifies the overall process and automation asset management process. We use a framework driven approach to ensure that you get the most out of your automation investment.</blockquote>	<p>In many organizations, software testing remains a cumbersome, manual, error-prone process that results in extended testing cycles. This causes delays in application releases, and often results in software that fails to meet quality standards. Test automation helps minimize that risk and ensures quality, while dramatically speeding time-to-market. Automation can improve test coverage and yield higher quality products. It can potentially save thousands of test execution hours and provide significant cost savings. However, some organizations continue to face challenges in realizing the full potential of their acquired test automation tools. The complexity of automation technologies and the lack of in-house expertise needed to implement and manage these powerful automation tools are key reasons why. This often results in poor automation practices and frustrated resources. Test engineers end up spending too much time doing script maintenance and fixing automation assets, rather than actually executing scripts and realizing the ROI of test automation.</p>	<p>Sodality understands these challenges. We have developed an automation methodology that simplifies the overall automation and automation asset management process. We use a framework driven approach to ensure that you get the most out of your automation investment. This framework based automation approach is built on three key principles – Reusability, Maintainability and Expandability. Using a software development approach to automation, we create reusable components to minimize redundancy. We design the framework for extreme script maintainability, thus minimizing time spent in updating scripts and other automation assets when application changes. We know every client’s environment is different. We follow a systematic approach that helps us understand every client’s specific testing needs. This allows us customize a solution that fits their environment. This structured approach has resulted in a high success rate in providing automation solutions that reduce time, costs and risks associated with deploying them within the Enterprise.</p>	<p>Our structured approach to automation is as illustrated below:		[Test Automation Structured Approach.png]</p>	<p>Contact us now for a free assessment of your automation needs.</p>	</div><!--END toggle-container-->	</div><!--End toggle-wrap-->	<div class="toggle-wrap">	<span class="trigger"><a href="#">PERFORMANCE TESTING</a></span>	<div class="toggle-container">	<blockquote class="light">Do you know whether your mission-critical applications will meet the performance and scalability that your business requires? How do you decrease the risk of poor application performance or catastrophic failure when deploying a multi-user system? Is your application infrastructure optimized?</blockquote>	<p>Performance issues in production can disrupt business, impair productivity and impact credibility. Hence, it is imperative to ensure that all applications are thoroughly testing before going live. However, with today’s complex applications that include multiple servers, network devices and distributed software components, it has become increasingly difficult to isolate, identify and fix the causes of failures. To effectively test these complex applications you need the right processes, expertise and technology.Making Sodality your performance testing partner is the fastest way to get a total solution to address all your performance testing requirements across the enterprise.</p>	<p>Sodality’s performance testing service is designed to help mitigate the risks of application failures and ensure performance in production. After more than a decade of performance testing experience we have developed sound processes and methodologies that help take the guess work out of performance testing and provide a disciplined approach that provides predictable outcomes. With this structured approach we have helped clients optimize their application infrastructures, thus ensuring the best possible end user experience for their applications. The goal of our performance service is to provide you the best practices and tools expertise to help you meet your application performance objectives at every stage of the software development lifecycle.</p>	<h4 class="title">Our Methodology</h4>	<p>Sodality’s methodology uses a structured approach to performance testing thus making it efficient and repeatable.
